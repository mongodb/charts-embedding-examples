MongoDB Charts Embedding Example - Verified Signature Auth in Node
==================================================================

Background
----------
MongoDB Charts allows you to create visualizations of your MongoDB data using a simple web interface.
You can view the visualizations within the Charts UI, or you can use the Embedding feature to render
the charts in an external web application. When you embed a chart, you can choose whether you want
it to be Unauthenticated (meaning anyone who has the embed code can view the chart), or to use
"Verified Signature" authentication (which checks the integrity of a signature in the URL before the
chart will render).

For the "Unauthenticated" option, you can copy the provided snippet and include it in any web site;
no extra steps are required.

The Verified Signature option requires a few more steps to implement but it is
more secure â€” your app will generate the signature on the server side after first authenticating
and authorizing the user, and the URL will stop working after a specified time period.

This project contains a simple sample app showing how to implement "Verified Signature" authentication
using Node js. Samples for other languages and platforms are provided elsewhere in this
repository.

Preparing your Chart for Embedding
----------------------------------

1. Log onto MongoDB Charts

2. If you haven't done so already, create a chart on any dashboard that you would like to embed.

3. Go to the Data Sources tab, find the data source that you are using on the chart, and choose
   *Embedding Options* from the *...* menu. Make sure that embedding is enabled for this data source,
   using either authentication mode.

4. Find the chart you want to embed, click the *...* menu and select Embed Chart.

5. Select the *Verified Signature* tab and turn on embedding.

6. Copy the IFRAME embed code from this dialog and keep it handy

7. Get the Embedding Signing Key from the Admin Settings page. If you are not a Charts Admin you
   will need to request this info from someone with this role.

Running this Sample
-------------------
1. Ensure you have Node installed. You can confirm with `node --version`. On some
operating systems, Node available as the `nodejs` binary instead.

2. Clone the Git repository or download the code to your computer.

3. Open the *server.js* file (server-side code), and replace the
    `~REPLACE~` placeholders with the appropriate values:
    - `~REPLACE~CHARTS_EMBEDDING_BASE_URL` with the base URL of your charts instance, e.g.
       https://charts.mongodb.com/charts-foo-abcde
    - `~REPLACE~CHARTS_TENANT_ID` with the value of the *tenant* parameter from the IFRAME snippet you
       copied from Charts
    - `~REPLACE~EMBEDDING_SIGNING_KEY` with the Embedding Signing key you obtained above

4. Open the *static/index.html* file (client-side code), and replace:
    - `~REPLACE~CHART_ID` with the value of the *id* parameter from the IFRAME snippet you copied from Charts

5. Run `npm install` to install the package dependencies

6. Run `node server.js` to start the server

6. You should see the chart embedded within the sample page on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

Next Steps
----------
Once you're ready to embed charts in your own applications, keep the following in mind:

 * Always keep the Embedding Signing Key secure, and never put it inside client code. Anyone who
   has this key will be able to embed charts in any application.

 * Always authenticate users and perform any required authorization checks before generating the
   signed embedding URLs. The value of this mechanism is that you can restrict who can view the
   embedded charts, but this won't work if you give the signed URLs out to anonymous users!

 * Consider what expiration period is appropriate. The signed URLs include a timestamp, which
   Charts will compare against the current time, within the tolerance of the specified expiry period.
   Depending on the architecture of your application, you may want a very short expiry period
   (e.g. if you generate a new signature on every request) or a longer one (if the URL needs to
   be cached).
